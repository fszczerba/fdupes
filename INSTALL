Installing fdupes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To install the program, issue the following commands:

make fdupes
su root
make install

This will install the program in /usr/local/bin. You may change this 
to a different location by editing the Makefile. Please refer to
the Makefile for an explanation of compile-time options. If you're
having trouble compiling, please take a look at the Makefile.

UPGRADING NOTE: When upgrading from a version prior to 1.2, it should 
be noted that the default installation directory for the fdupes man
page has changed from "/usr/man" to "/usr/local/man". If installing
to the default location you should delete the old man page before
proceeding. This file would be named "/usr/man/man1/fdupes.1".

A test directory is included so that you may familiarise yourself
with the way fdupes operates. You may test the program before
installing it by issuing a command such as "./fdupes testdir" 
or "./fdupes -r testdir", just to name a couple of examples. Refer
to the documentation for information on valid options.
